Ideas:
papers submitted as blog posts
have website in github?

- expand to 48H - this is more like a hackathon rather than a half-day conference
- keep the same four groups of questions, let people integrate the four groups
- over 48H let people work on the topic
- in June, let people choose a group, in July let them iterate over

- have a "surprise theme"?
- get everybody to submit blog posts and bios, publish these in July, so everybody knows each other.

- 75% working on themes.
- 25% developing a framework.

- the async research workshop could be a research output as well.



submission through a markdown 

blogpost replaces short talks from the participants.
blogposts should ibe able to include external links to videos/images etc.
present provocations 

workshop and divide into groups - can we do this in comments? how can we replicate this asynchronously?

## synchronous: 
 
- miro - whiteboard software with comments and video chat

## 

## Process:

1. decide to join, send us a bio and blog post which will be published on the workshop site.
2. during the NIME workshop period, we will have a 48H forum/hackathon for develop ideas (fix this later).
2.5 can people join in without an abstract?
3. the outcome will be presented as a new framework for (the topic) published on the website.
4. the outcomes will be considered for publication or future stuff.
